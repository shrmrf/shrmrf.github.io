Hey there!! I'm [Taimoor](https://about.me/taimoori). I go by `@ich_code` on Twitter, `shrmrf` on Github and `sysarcher` on various places. Why KISS?

You'll find my CV here soon. (Todo: Add link, I haven't added a link because right now, there's too much info on the CV i.e. phone number etc.)

I love to work, hack and have fun with software. Rust is my new favorite thing.
