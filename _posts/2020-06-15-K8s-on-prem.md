I have spent time looking at edge deployments of kubernetes, especially, those that are managed by the Ops team in an industry 4.0 setting. Here are my candidates:

- Kubeedge
- k3s
- k3os
- StarlingX

I present my brief impressions of each below. This post will need updates as my research goes on.

### Background

_Edge_ is often used as a vague term for either one of CDN, factory network or IT data center. There is a fair amount of confusion where cloud transforms into "Edge".

_Fog_ apparently is used to describe the same concepts and maintains the vaporous water analogue that is so popular in this space (think about it: data lake, fog, clouds ...)

_kubernetes_ is a container orchestrator that has become extremely popular in the last few years. It provides a common API to manage all containers running in your system.
