I have spent time looking at edge deployments of kubernetes, especially, those that are managed by the Ops team in an industry 4.0 setting. Here are my candidates:

- Kubeedge
- k3s
- k3os
- StarlingX

I present my brief impressions of each below. This post will need updates as my research goes on.

### Background

_Edge_ is often used as a vague term for either one of CDN, factory network or IT data center. There is a fair amount of confusion where cloud transforms into "Edge".

_Fog_ apparently is used to describe the same concepts and maintains the vaporous water analogue that is so popular in this space (think about it: data lake, fog, clouds ...)

_kubernetes_ is a container orchestrator that has become extremely popular in the last few years. It provides a common API to manage all containers running in your system.

_Cloud native_ is used to describe container-first and container-based systems. (my own definition)

_CNCF_ is the cloud native computing foundation. It manages projects that specifically target cloud native systems. It does not manage all cloud-native projects. To the contrary, there is a small list of projects that are managed by CNCF.

_Linux Foundation_ maintains a set of open source projects. LF Edge is the subgroup that does this for projects targeting Edge deployments. LF projects are of all types.

_OpenStack Foundation_ is another foundation that was originally formed for OpenStack's projects (next item) but it seems to now be accepting projects related to other systems.

_OpenStack_ is the most popular open source cloud. It's the OG thing: was popular before docker, k8s or anything container-related was mainstream. There are still many users of OpenStack in the wild and it's not going anywhere soon.


### Kubeedge
_describe Kubeedge briefly and discuss the need for cloud-edge sync - especially for metadata_

### k3s
_describe k3s briefly and discuss the overhead of k8s api and where k3s differs (e.g. etcd)_

### k3os
_benefits of not maintaining your OS and it's downsides_

### StarlingX
_Describe StarlingX and my contributions towards the project. Explain why it's the most complete Edge Platform. Annoyances too._
