I spent all day today fiddling around with PowerPoint. I am doing a presentation soon(ish) around "Event Driven Microservices" (a lightning talk) which is made hard because of the time limit.

The goal is to introduce events and derivatives of events. Why events are the _source of truth_ for all software. Below I dump my thoughts so I can come back to them later.
