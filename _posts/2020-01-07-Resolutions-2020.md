Resolutions... Goals... things you write down to _not_ follow! But you write them down anyways..

[2020 used to be hindsight](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hindsight%20is%2020%2F20) but not any more. It's here. I'll write down my own resolutions for this year here...

#### Technology
- Continue with my FP journey (Clojure and F#)
- Keep on learning Rust and Golang
- (Maybe) look into Ziglang
- DDD and Software Architecture. I have been reading a lot about it recently and will continue to try to do so. Especially Wlachsinn's book!

#### Health
- Start exercising regularly
- Eat healthy food normally (it's fine to eat unhealthy _sometimes_)
- Swim!

#### Misc
- Start a side-project in Rust (embedded??)
- Start a web Frontend (Clojurescript??) project

#### Conclusion
I'm sure I'll miss out on some things and do some right... Fingers crossed.
