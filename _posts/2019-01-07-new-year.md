This is a post for me to set up a new year's wishlist and track it.

- [ ] Learn Clojure: I want to learn some FP this year
- [ ] Improve Rust: work on some internal/external tools at work
- [ ] TSN: important in industrial applications
- [ ] Yocto: Finally master this crap
- [ ] ClearLinux: What I want to be working on
- [ ] Firecracker: Get this thing running on my hardware


Non Technical Goals
- [ ] Exercise: get a routine in place
- [ ] Read: Some book every month
- [ ] Manage: manage time better


This list is kept to a minimum so the goals are achievable. Wish me luck!!
