_Now, this is a running-log post. I am going to try to document my experience with Kata containers and Kubernetes._

### Getting Up and Running
I have previously had problems with Virtualbox and KVM not playing well together. So, what I'm thinking of doing is setting `minikube`'s `vm-driver` to `kvm2`. 

#### Pre-requisites
- A Kubernetes env. (I'll use `minikube` for now.)
- Kata Containers installed but I'm assuming the default runtime for `docker run` is still `runc`.
- KVM installation is (hopefully) implied

Set the default driver for minikube. (note, this might not be necessary if Virtualbox and KVM play well for you.) 
```bash
minikube config set vm-driver kvm2
minikube start  # should start in KVM
```
