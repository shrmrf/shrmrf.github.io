I use Vim a lot. And if you're a productive user of Vim, you will definitely appreciate the following remaps:

- ESC: I have remapped the Escape key to CAPSLOCK. Who uses CapsLock? ESC on the other hand is a Vim user's go-to reflex. So keep it close-by.
- ESC+HJKL: For navigation. Why would you use muscles to move over to the arrow keys when you have them under your fingers.
